# 🪖 DS VOICE TRAINER: FIELD OPS
# ===============================

> **Mission Briefing:**  
> Train like a future Drill Sergeant. 
  Recite official Army scripts, sharpen your command voice, and get real-time, AI-driven feedback.
  From boot camp to black hat—this is your verbal ruck march.

## 🎯 Mission Objective

The **DS Voice Trainer** is a tactical-grade AI tool designed for soldiers preparing for Drill Sergeant Academy. 
It transforms raw script memorization into a fully interactive, gamified training simulator—combining precision scoring, 
visual performance indicators, and themed reinforcement based on military units and schools.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept & Reinforcement Engine

This app isn’t just a voice grader—it’s a **memory combat trainer**.

We use **Positive Reinforcement Memory Stimulation (PRMS)** to lock in script retention and boost neural performance under pressure.

### How it Works:

| Feature                      | Reinforcement Effect                                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Correct Word Recited**  | Word glows green, pulse FX, XP awarded                               |
| ❌ **Missed Word**           | Flash red, glitch noise, no XP earned                                |
| 🧠 **Repeat Accuracy**       | Higher repeat scores = more points + theme unlocks                   |
| 🏅 **Drill Streaks**         | Consecutive 100% runs = badges, ranks, or secret visual skins         |
| 🔁 **Error Recall Training** | Missed words are stored and practiced in micro-drills                |

The result? Your brain gets **visually, audibly, and tactically rewarded** when memory and verbal output align correctly. 
It’s built like a battle drill—with performance feedback designed to *burn it into memory*.

## 🔊 App Launch Customization

> **[🪖] Startup Sound FX**  
> Play your own **motivational intro sound** every time the app launches—like a war sim or FPS boot-up.

### Drop your custom `.mp3` file here:
- `/assets/sounds/startup_theme.mp3`

It’ll trigger on launch. Replace it anytime.  
Suggestions: “Attention on Deck,” “Wake Up, Troop,” or any custom Drill Sergeant intro bark.

## 🧪 Local Test Instructions

### Clone & Set Up
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewportRiver/Drill-Sim.git
cd ds-voice-trainer/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run a Test Comparison

python main.py

This will simulate a transcript vs. the official script and print a full feedback report.
