THE BASIC FORMAT FOR ALL MODULES

An oral module presentation is set-up into a three (3) step process. The three step process is the exact same for any and all oral module presentations. Below is each step of the process explained:


STEP I


All modules start the exact same way -

Get the Audiences Attention (Class, ATTENTION or Let Me Have Your Attention)

The next (position or movement) I will name and explain, have demonstrated, and you will conduct practical work on is .........(whatever you are instructing).

In Step I, you NAME and EXPLAIN what you are instructing:

You will NAME the position or movement and then EXPLAIN what it is used for. You then NAME the command(s) used to execute the position or movement. After naming the command(s) you will then EXPLAIN what type of command(s) it is. There are 5 different types of commands but you are primarily concerned with only 2 of the types of commands. First is the Two Part Command and second is the Combined Command.

The Two Part Command is just that; it consists of 2 parts. The 1st part is the Preparatory Command and the 2nd Part is the Command of Execution.

An example of a Two Part Command is Demonstrator, ATTENTION. Demonstrator is the Preparatory Command (it identifies who you are addressing or what action to take); ATTENTION is the Command of Execution (it tells when to execute the action). The Combined Command is a command where the Preparatory Command and Command of Execution are combined or one. For example FALL-IN or AT EASE.

STEP II


Step II always starts the same -

Just as you stated in Step I, you will now HAVE DEMONSTRATED what you talked about above.

The first thing you do is Post the Demonstrator. This is the person who will execute (demonstrate) what you tell them to do. After you have posted your demonstrator, YOU MUST IDENTIFY or OPEN WHAT METHOD OF INSTRUCTION you will use to teach your audience.

There are three different Methods of Instruction or MOI's used - 1) Talk-Through; 2) By-The-Numbers; and 3) Step-By-Step.

NOTE: If you fail to identify the MOI, your demonstrator WILL NOT and CAN NOT execute. This is extremely important!

The beginning of Step II will look like this:

Demonstrator, POST. I will use the (Talk-Through; By-The-Numbers; Step-By-Step) Method of Instruction to teach you this position/movement.

You will then teach the audience while your demonstrator executes what you say. This is where you HAVE DEMONSTRATED. It is important for you to not only know the words to the module but also how it looks and how to properly execute it.


STEP III


Step III is basically the same for all modules.

Slight variations occur depending on the movements to be executed. This is where you CONDUCT PRACTICAL WORK. The class or audience will now do what you just taught and had demonstrated to them. Step III is the same as Step II, but you will now use the Preparatory Command "Class" instead of "Demonstrator". The beginning will look like this:
Class, ATTENTION. We will now conduct practical work on this position/movement using the (Talk-Through; By-The-Numbers; Step-By-Step) Method of Instruction.
From here you go back up to Step II and repeat what you just taught.
